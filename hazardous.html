            <h2>What is Hazardous Air?</h2>
            <p>Hazardous air pollutants, also known as toxic air pollutants or air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="causes" class="article">
            <h2>Causes of Hazardous Air</h2>
            <p>Hazardous air quality can be caused by various factors, both natural and human-made. Here are some common causes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Industrial Emissions:</strong> Factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities emit pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM), which contribute to poor air quality.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Vehicle Emissions:</strong> Cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles emit pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially in densely populated areas with heavy traffic.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels:</strong> The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, heating, and transportation releases harmful pollutants into the air, including carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).</li>
            
                <li><strong>Agricultural Activities:</strong> Farming practices like burning crop residues, using fertilizers, and raising livestock can release pollutants such as ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Wildfires:</strong> Natural wildfires, as well as those caused by human activity, release large amounts of smoke, particulate matter, and other pollutants into the air, which can spread over vast areas and degrade air quality.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Construction and Demolition:</strong> Dust and other particulate matter generated during construction, demolition, and excavation activities can contribute to localized air pollution.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Natural Sources:</strong> Volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and pollen can also affect air quality, though their impact is generally more localized or episodic compared to human-generated pollution.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Chemical Reactions:</strong> Chemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere, such as the formation of ground-level ozone (O3) through the interaction of sunlight with pollutants like NOx and VOCs, can lead to the formation of secondary pollutants that degrade air quality.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </section>
        
        <section id="effects" class="article">
            <h2>Effects of Hazardous Air</h2>
            <p>Hazardous air pollution can have serious effects on human health, the environment, and the economy. Some of the common effects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respiratory Issues:</strong> Breathing in polluted air can lead to respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and reduced lung function.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Problems:</strong> Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> Pollutants in the air can harm ecosystems, damage crops, and contribute to climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Costs:</strong> The healthcare costs associated with treating air pollution-related illnesses and the loss of productivity due to sickness can impose a significant economic burden on society.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's essential to take measures to reduce air pollution through initiatives such as transitioning to clean energy sources, improving vehicle emissions standards, and promoting sustainable practices.</p>

        <section id="prevention" class="article">
            <h2>Prevention and Mitigation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Industrial Emissions:</strong> Implementing pollution control technologies, promoting cleaner production methods, and enforcing strict emissions standards can help reduce the release of pollutants from industrial sources.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Promote Clean Transportation:</strong> Encouraging the use of electric vehicles, improving public transportation systems, and implementing vehicle emissions standards can help reduce emissions from transportation sources.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Transition to Renewable Energy:</strong> Investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease air pollution from energy production.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Implement Sustainable Agricultural Practices:</strong> Encouraging practices such as organic farming, precision agriculture, and efficient fertilizer use can minimize agricultural emissions and reduce air pollution.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Prevent and Control Wildfires:</strong> Implementing measures such as controlled burns, firebreaks, and early detection systems can help prevent wildfires and reduce their impact on air quality.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Regulate Construction and Demolition Activities:</strong> Enforcing regulations on dust control, using cleaner construction equipment, and promoting recycling and reuse can mitigate air pollution from construction and demolition.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Protect Natural Areas:</strong> Preserving and restoring natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands can help maintain air quality by providing natural filters for pollutants and reducing emissions from land use change.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Support International Cooperation:</strong> Collaborating with other countries to address transboundary air pollution, share best practices, and develop global solutions can help tackle air quality issues on a broader scale.</li>
            </ul>
